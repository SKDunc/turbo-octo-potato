    <h1>Learning the Signs of Adoration</h1>
    <p>You see a lady and you have a crush on her. It's easy to get lost in figuring out what a woman is thinking when your judgment is clouded by your desire. So, what are some surefire signs that she's feeling you, too? </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Body Language: Is her body open and her chest pointed towards you? Does she face you wherever you move? Does she lean in when you're close?</li>
        <li>Eye Contact: Does she look into your eyes often? If so, does her gaze remain fixated a second or two longer than normal? <em>Note: A lot of women use eye contact as their main tool of getting a man's attention.</em></li>
        <li>Breaking the Touch Barrier: Does she touch your arm when close? Is she open to hugging you? Could you touch her shoulder, hand or upper back without shrugging you off?</li>
        <li>Energy: Does she act nervous around you--giggles, constant smiling, fidgeting, touching her face, neck or hair?</li>
        <li>How She Speaks: Does she compliment you often?  Does she laugh at your jokes? Does she value your opinion?</li>
    </ul>
 
   <p>Many women will not come out and just tell you that they like you. Some do, but, as a man, don't expect it. Notice that women will put themselves on situations to be pursued by you.
